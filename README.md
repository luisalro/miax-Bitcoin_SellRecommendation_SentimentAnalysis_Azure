### Introduction

The cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) market continues to consolidate as customers and providers push for more security, innovation and scalability. According to Gartner, AWS is evaluated as the leader in cloud IaaS with the highest score in both axes of measurement, ability to execute and completeness of vision.

To carry out this lab, we chose Microsoft Azure as a cloud tool due to its manageability, easy integration and low cost. Likewise, it is an intuitive tool that facilitates the work of any beginner in the world of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

### Instructions

we will use different services offered by Microsoft Azure. We will create a series of Logic Apps to ingest sentiment data on Twitter for the Bitcoin hashtag and the prices of the cryptocurrency itself. On the page https://www.blockchain.com/api/exchange_rates_api we can obtain the exchange values ​​of said cryptocurrency in real time.

Subsequently, we will use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (classic) with which we will implement a linear regression model to predict the price of Bitcoin based on the correlation between the sentiment expressed towards the cryptocurrency on Twitter and its exchange value. Once we obtain the prediction of the model, sales recommendations will be made once it is detected that the cryptocurrency is overvalued compared to the market value. These recommendations will be sent via SMS to our mobile phone using the Trilio text messaging service (https://www.trilio.io).
